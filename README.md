# KeyboardLayouts

This repository contains keyboard layouts for the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).

This tool is no longer supported by Microsoft, but still works under Windows 10. 

However you will have to either:
* Enable 8.3 format filenames before installing it (which I don't recommend)

  or

* Copy the file in the program directory

  c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4\

  into a directory whose path only uses names in 8.3 format (and no spaces), e.g.

  C:\MSKLC\

  and run the application from that directory.



*Note: An alternative to the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator is [KbdEdit](http://www.kbdedit.com/). 
If you want to create your own keyboard layout, you might prefer
to try this tool.*
