# KeyboardLayouts

This repository contains keyboard layouts for the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).

This tool is no longer supported by Microsoft, but - in my experience - still works under Windows 10.

*Note: An alternative to the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator is [KbdEdit](http://www.kbdedit.com/). 
If you want to create your own keyboard layout, you might prefer
to try this tool.*
